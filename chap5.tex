\chapter{Visgoth System}\label{visgoth-ch}

The Visgoth system is responsible for monitoring client and server performance
statistics to ensure that a certain latency is met. Using an experimental
model, the system can reduce the granularity of the data delivered to the
client in an attempt to reduce latency. The system aims at using the collected
statistics to adapt to client or server load by aggregating the visualization,
reducing the overall data that must be transferred and rendered by the client. \\
