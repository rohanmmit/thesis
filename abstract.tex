In this thesis I designed and implemented a system for interactively analysing
large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets. Trained experts are able to analyze
an EEG and determine if a patient has experienced a seizure or stroke, and then
change the treatment as necessary. Currently there is a large corpus of
unanalyzed EEG data since the analysis is time intensive for large datasets.
Fast analysis is essential for building a set of example data of EEG results,
allowing doctors to quickly classify the behavior of future EEG results. My
system aims to reduce the cost of analysis by providing near real-time
interaction with the datasets. The system has three optimized layers, handling
the storage, computation, and visualization of the data. I evaluate the design
choices of each layer, comparing 3 different implementations across different
workloads.
