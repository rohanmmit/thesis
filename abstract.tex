%% The text of your abstract and nothing else (other than comments) goes here.
%% It will be single-spaced and the rest of the text that is supposed to go on
%% the abstract page will be generated by the abstractpage environment.  This
%% file should be \input (not \include 'd) from cover.tex.

Because most data processing systems are distributed in nature, data must be transferred
between machines. Currently, Spark, a prominent such system, predetermines the strategies for shuffling this data,
but in certain situations, different shuffle strategies would improve performance.
We add functionality to track metrics about the data during the job and appropriately adapt the shuffle strategy.
We show improvements in ShuffledRDD performance, joins using Spark's RDD interface, and joins in Spark SQl.
